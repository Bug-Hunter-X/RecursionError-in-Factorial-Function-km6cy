This repository demonstrates a common error in Python: a RecursionError caused by improper handling of the base case in a recursive function. The `factorial` function, as initially written, lacks proper handling for negative input, leading to infinite recursion.  The solution demonstrates how to correctly add a check for negative input to avoid the error.
